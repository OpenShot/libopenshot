## Hardware Acceleration

OpenShot now supports experimental hardware acceleration, both for encoding and
decoding videos. When enabled, this can either speed up those operations or slow
them down, depending on the power and features supported by your graphics card.
Please see [doc/HW-ACCELL.md](doc/HW-ACCEL.md) for more information.

## Documentation

Beautiful HTML documentation can be generated using Doxygen.
```
make doc
```
