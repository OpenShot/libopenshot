	 * @brief This class adjusts the blur of an image, and can be animated
	 * with openshot::Keyframe curves over time.
	 *
	 * Adjusting the blur of an image over time can create many different powerful effects. To achieve a
	 * box blur effect, use identical horizontal and vertical blur values. To achieve a Gaussian blur,
	 * use 3 iterations, a sigma of 3.0, and a radius between 3 and X (depending on how much blur you want).
