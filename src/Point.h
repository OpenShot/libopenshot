	 * Points have a primary coordinate and a left and right handle coordinate.

	 * moves between the primary coordinate and the next primary coordinate when the
	 * interpolation mode is BEZIER.  When using LINEAR or CONSTANT, the handles are
	 * ignored.
	 *
	 * Please see the following <b>Example Code</b>:
	 * \code
	 * Coordinate c1(3,9);
	 * Point p1(c1, BEZIER);
	 * assert(c1.X == 3);
	 * assert(c1.Y == 9);
