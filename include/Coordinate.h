	 * @brief This class represents a Cartesian coordinate (X, Y) used in the Keyframe animation system.
	 *
	 * Animation involves the changing (i.e. interpolation) of numbers over time.  A series of Coordinate
	 * objects allows us to plot a specific curve or line used during interpolation.  In other words, it helps us
	 * control how a number changes over time (quickly or slowly).
	 *
	 * Please see the following <b>Example Code</b>:
	 * \code
	 * Coordinate c1(2,4);
	 * assert(c1.X == 2.0f);
	 * assert(c1.Y == 4.0f);
	 * \endcode
