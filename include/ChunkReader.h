	 * For example, if you want a small version with reduced quality, you can
	 * choose the THUMBNAIL version. This is used on the ChunkReader

	 * @brief This class reads a special chunk-formatted file, which can be easily
	 * shared in a distributed environment.
	 *
	 * It stores the video in small "chunks", which are really just short video clips,
	 * a few seconds each. A ChunkReader only needs the part of the chunk that contains
	 * the frames it is looking for. For example, if you only need the end of a video,
	 * only the last few chunks might be needed to successfully access those openshot::Frame objects.
	 *
	 * \code
	 * // This example demonstrates how to read a chunk folder and access frame objects inside it.
	 * ChunkReader r("/home/jonathan/apps/chunks/chunk1/", FINAL); // Load highest quality version of this chunk file
	 * r.DisplayInfo(); // Display all known details about this chunk file
	 * r.Open(); // Open the reader
	 *
	 * // Access frame 1
	 * r.GetFrame(1)->Display();
	 *
	 * // Close the reader
	 * r.Close();
