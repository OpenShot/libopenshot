 * @mainpage OpenShot Video Editing Library C++ API
 *
 * Welcome to the OpenShot Video Editing Library (libopenshot) C++ API. This library was developed to
 * make high-quality video editing and animation solutions freely available to the world. With a focus
 * on stability, performance, and ease-of-use, we believe libopenshot is the best cross-platform,
 * open-source video editing library in the world. This library powers
 * <a href="http://www.openshot.org">OpenShot Video Editor</a> (version 2.0+), the highest rated video
 * editor available on Linux (and soon Windows & Mac). It could also <b>power</b> your next video editing project!
 *
 * Our documentation is quite extensive, including descriptions and examples of almost every class, method,
 * and parameter. Getting started is easy.
 *
 * All you need is a <b>single</b> include to get started:
 * @code
 * #include "OpenShot.h"
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### The Basics ###
 * To understand libopenshot, we must first learn about the basic building blocks:.
 *  - <b>Readers</b> - A reader is used to read a video, audio, image file, or stream and return openshot::Frame objects.
 *    - A few common readers are openshot::FFmpegReader, openshot::TextReader, openshot::ImageReader, openshot::ChunkReader, and openshot::FrameMapper
 *
 *  - <b>Writers</b> - A writer consumes openshot::Frame objects, and is used to write / create a video, audio, image file, or stream.
 *    - A few common writers are openshot::FFmpegWriter, openshot::ImageWriter, and openshot::ChunkWriter
 *
 *  - <b>Timeline</b> - A timeline allows many openshot::Clip objects to be trimmed, arranged, and layered together.
 *    - The openshot::Timeline is a special kind of reader, built from openshot::Clip objects (each clip containing a reader)
 *
 *  - <b> Keyframe</b> - A Keyframe is used to change values of properties over time on the timeline (curve-based animation).
 *    - The openshot::Keyframe, openshot::Point, and openshot::Coordinate are used to animate properties on the timeline.
 *
 * ### Example Code ###
 * Now that you understand the basic building blocks of libopenshot, lets take a look at a simple example,
 * where we use a reader to access frames of a video file.

 * @code
 * // Create a reader for a video
 * FFmpegReader r("MyAwesomeVideo.webm");
 * r.Open(); // Open the reader
 *
 * // Get frame number 1 from the video
 * std::shared_ptr<Frame> f = r.GetFrame(1);
 *
 * // Now that we have an openshot::Frame object, lets have some fun!
 * f->Display(); // Display the frame on the screen
 * f->DisplayWaveform(); // Display the audio waveform as an image
 * f->Play(); // Play the audio through your speaker
 *
 * // Close the reader
 * r.Close();
 * @endcode
 *
 * ### A Closer Look at the Timeline ###
 * The <b>following graphic</b> displays a timeline, and how clips can be arranged, scaled, and layered together. It
 * also demonstrates how the viewport can be scaled smaller than the canvas, which can be used to zoom and pan around the
 * canvas (i.e. pan & scan).
